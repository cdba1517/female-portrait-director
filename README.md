# Female Portrait Prompt Director Skill

Female Portrait Prompt Director Skill is a structured prompt-generation and visual-direction system for AI image creation. It supports clean lifestyle portraits, restrained curve-focused lifestyle portraits, urban fashion photography, gufeng fantasy portraits, and e-commerce clothing model images. V1.2 locks explicit parameters, loads only the selected style route, and directs a coherent photographed moment with connected actions, gaze, environment, camera, and lighting.

This project is not a generic prompt collection. It is an extensible female portrait prompt Skill framework.

## Project Scope

Generate complete prompts from a small set of input parameters. Preserve the user's explicit requirements while visually expanding facial features, body shape, outfit, scene, camera and pose, lighting, filters, platform purpose, and negative constraints. Subjects must be clearly adult women. Outputs emphasize realistic photography, restrained expression, visual coherence, and stable generation.

## Supported Styles

- Clean lifestyle portraits
- Restrained curve-focused lifestyle portraits
- Urban fashion photography
- Gufeng fantasy portraits
- E-commerce clothing model images

## Core Capabilities

- Lock user-specified parameters and only refine or stabilize them.
- Route each request through one on-demand style file and avoid conflicting style keywords.
- Parse face, body, outfit, scene, camera and pose, lighting, and filter modules.
- Expand short parameters into a coherent photographed moment instead of mechanically repeating them.
- Fuse the expanded modules into natural, detailed, copy-ready prompts with photography-director intent.
- Preserve clothing-display priority for e-commerce images and explicit safety boundaries for curve-focused portraits.

## Quick Start

When using this repository as a Codex Skill, invoke `$female-portrait-director`. Minimal example:

```text
Style: clean lifestyle portrait
Scene: window seat in a cafe
Outfit: white knitted cardigan + light-colored inner layer
Mood: clean and gentle
Aspect ratio: 9:16
```

The system returns locked parameters, a complete copy-ready prompt, and negative constraints. See [parameter_schema.md](skill/parameter_schema.md) for the full input schema and [usage_examples.md](skill/usage_examples.md) for examples.

## Output Format

```text
1. Locked parameters
2. Module analysis
3. Final prompt
4. Negative constraints
```
